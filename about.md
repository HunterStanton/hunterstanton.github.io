I am a software developer who has been a fan of programming since I first downloaded Visual Studio 2008 when I was 14. I make it a habit every day to learn more about programming, so I try to read a new article about it or read more documentation every day. Other than my programming, I love to play the bass guitar and write music, make maps for video games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and I love to ski whenever I get the chance. I'm also a big fan of security, ethical hacking, and reverse engineering and have uncovered bugs in properties by companies such as Google and Microsoft.

I also really love Apple products and have since the second-generation iPod Touch came out in 2008 and I received one for Christmas that year. I got into iOS programming around the release of iOS 8 and have loved it ever since then. I love making apps for all platforms, including Apple Watch and Apple TV.
