I am a mobile (iOS/Android and Xamarin) and C# developer from Rogersville, TN. I enjoy writing scalable, performant code that powers mobile apps and web applications. I'm very interested in learning all I can about computer science and software engineering, and I actively work every day to keep up with what is new in the field. I am a motivated self-starter who is entirely self taught, and I also have a penchant for entrepreneurship, which is why I co-founded my own business to sell my desktop software and mobile apps to the public.

I also really love Apple products and have since the second-generation iPod Touch came out in 2008 and I received one for Christmas that year. I got into iOS programming around the release of iOS 8 and have loved it ever since then. I love making apps for all platforms, including Apple Watch and Apple TV.

## Work Experience

### Current
*Co-Founder / Lead iOS Developer (Swift, Objective-C)* - [Nexus Heights](http://nexusheights.org) - December 2015 to Present

Co-founded the company and am the sole developer for all of our mobile and desktop apps, of which there are currently 6 live on the App Store and more in development for platforms such as tvOS, iOS, watchOS, and macOS.

Also handle interaction with our clients, and help make sure that they are satisfied throughout the process and that come back for repeat business.

*Lead iOS Developer (Swift, Xamarin)* - [Drover Rideshare](http://droverrideshare.com) - May 2016 to Present

Worked with a team of developers to develop a mobile ridesharing application akin to Uber or Lyft. Handled disputes when they came up and guided the team on what direction they should be taking for implementing certain functionalities.

Also contributed significantly to the codebase for the Java-powered REST API and helped influence design decisions with how it should work and what it needed to fulfill the needs of the Android and iOS mobile applications.
