This is my personal website and portfolio. It is based off the brilliant Jekyll theme at https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Jekyll-Mono, as you can clearly see (because this is a fork of that repository).

If you want a portfolio/personal site that looks like this one, go check that repository out. You will need Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com) to modify/test it offline, so make sure you have that downloaded and installed.
