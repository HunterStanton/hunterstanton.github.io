# Synx
So I recently discovered the wonderful utility [Synx](https://github.com/venmo/synx) which solves a problem I'd had for the longest time and was never sure how to solve - keeping the filesystem equivalent to the Xcode project structure. Synx does it very well, and why it's not a built in feature to Xcode yet is beyond me.

I really love finding tools like this. They're so simple, yet they improve the Xcode dev workflow a ton. I will never go without this tool in the future, and it will become a staple installation alongside the likes of CocoaPods.

I have updated all my public repositories to use it, as I believe this is usually the preferred by most devs, so I thought I'd go ahead and convert all my projects too. It also just looks cleaner, and makes Xcode project folders less of an unorganized mess.
